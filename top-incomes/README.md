## Data sources

The statistics for the top 1% income shares were downloaded from the [Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/may/16/top-income-earners).

The [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/) provides a few indicators, for example the [income share held by highest 10%](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.DST.10TH.10). However, the data is patchy at best.
